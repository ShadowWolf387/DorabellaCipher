The Dorabella Cipher

Since around 1897, this cipher has remained unsolved until now. Unlike most or all of the "solutions" you may find for this cipher, this is likely to remain the only solution that uses a normal mono-alphabetic substitution key. Other solutions typically rely on repeating letters in the key to create an arbitrary solution in an attempt to make it appear to be sort of normal English. The problem is Elgar didn't always write normal English. He often wrote in what is known as "Elgar speak". That is why it has remained unsolved for so long. The plaintext isn't exactly normal English.

The PDF file has most of the details of the solution. The various other files will be listed here as needed.

Various text files related to the solution


Dorabella-Solution.pdf

The initial solution file. This was put together rather quickly. For historic reasons, I did
save the aproximate time and date when I found the solution. Those were reconstructed from the
respective directory and file dates.


Dorabella-SolutionPt2.pdf

Because of some doubt, some more test runs were made including using another scoring file.
No new results to be reported. This has the final solution and has been kept updated.


DorabellaSol.pdf
DorabellaSol.txt

These files are almost the same. They contain a very brief copy of the cipher, the key, plaintext
and the best guess to the actual message.
